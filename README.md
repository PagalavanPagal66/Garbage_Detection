# Garbage Detection System Using CCTV through YOLO Algorithm and SMTP for Automatic Mailing System

This project aims to develop a system that can detect garbage using CCTV footage, utilizing the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for object detection. Upon detection of garbage, the system will automatically send an email notification to predefined recipients using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol).

## Introduction

With the increasing concerns over environmental pollution, effective waste management systems are essential. Traditional methods of waste collection and disposal often lack efficiency and effectiveness. This project proposes a novel approach by leveraging computer vision and email automation to enhance garbage detection and management processes.

## Features

- Real-time garbage detection using CCTV footage.
- Utilization of YOLO algorithm for accurate and efficient object detection.
- Automatic email notifications sent via SMTP upon garbage detection.
- Customizable email templates and recipient lists.
- User-friendly interface for configuration and monitoring.

## Usage

1. Run the main script:

python detection.py

2. The system will start monitoring the CCTV feed for garbage detection.
3. Upon detecting garbage, an email notification will be sent to the predefined recipients.
